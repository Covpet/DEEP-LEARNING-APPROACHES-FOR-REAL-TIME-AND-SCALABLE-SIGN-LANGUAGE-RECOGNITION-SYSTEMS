### DEEP-LEARNING-APPROACHES-FOR-REAL-TIME-AND-SCALABLE-SIGN-LANGUAGE-RECOGNITION-SYSTEMS

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a real-time, scalable sign language recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system identifies hand gestures for alphabets (A-Z) and numbers (0-9) to bridge communication barriers for individuals with hearing and speech impairments.

## Features
- High accuracy (96% on training data, 94% on validation data)
- Automated feature extraction using CNNs
- Scalable to larger datasets and adaptable for real-time use
